goalbuddy
=========

An app that helps friends set goals and hold each other accountable.

Inspired by Jerry Sienfield's calendar technique: mark a calendar with a big red X for each
day where you meet a daily goal (e.g. write jokes for 30 min). Continue marking the X's daily
until you achieve a chain of X's. At that point, Sienfield said all you need to keep in mind is
"don't break the chain." 

Keeping and growing the chain of X's helps motivate you to continue progressing against
your goals. GoalBuddy incorporates this calendar system and adds an element of social
support and social pressure by having a friend keep track of your progress as well.
